# Personal Intentions
My main goals for practicing yoga in my life is to enhance my meditation abilities and practices, and better develop my mind-body connection. Meditation is something I need in my life to help quiet my racing and anxious mind and help me build a stronger connection between my mind and body. Improving my meditation techniques will help me better control my emotions and thoughts and building a stronger mind-body connection will help me listen to my body when I’m in pain and have a better understanding as to why I’m in pain. Along with these enhanced meditation practices and better mind-body connection, another goal I have for practicing yoga is enhanced body health. Being strong and healthy in my body will aid in having a strong and healthy mind, which is extremely important to me.

# Yamas/Niyamas
To be able to control my mind which involves negative emotions and anxiety, the yama Ahimsa would be best for me to practice. Ahimsa is the practice of non-violence, in the sense of physical, mental, and emotional towards others and the self. A lot of my negative emotions and anxiety come from being emotionally violent to myself, so practicing this Ahimsa would help me realize that I need to have compassion for myself, and let go of my violent habits of negative thoughts and self-deprecation.
A virtue to practice that would help me cleanse myself of these negative and self-depracating thoughts would be the niyama Shaucha, or self-purification. Practicing Shaucha is to practice the cleansing of the body and mind, which would help me cleanse my mind of negative habits.

# Pranayama 
Nadi Shodhana (alternative nostril breathing) is a pranayama technique that helps to equilibrate the body. This pranyama technique would be beneficial for helping me quiet and control my mind by equilibrating the two halves of my body. This equilibration helps to create a stronger mind-body connection as it helps to center your body and mind. This pranayama is beneficial for balancing poses which I chose for stronger mind-body connections. 

# Pratyahara 
The practice of creating positive habits would help me meet my goals of enhancing my meditation techniques and creating a stronger mind-body connection. By creating the positive habit of meditating, I can enhance my meditation techniques which in turn will help me ease my racing mind and anxiety. Along with creating a positive habit of meditating, I can also create a positive habit of being kind and compassionate to myself, helping me break the negative habits of self-deprecation I have created.

# Mediation

<img width="565" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-28 at 2 13 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/104161364/170843029-d93f33ad-5e04-44ba-a88a-0942fd073f1d.png"> picture from sunwarror.com

The practice of meditation has aided in my path to create a stronger mind, and a stronger mind-body connection. My main goal for meditation was to learn how to control my mind, mainly my thoughts and emotions, and the breathwork meditation was the most beneficial in helping me with that. Breathwork meditation is the act of focusing on your breath and blocking out everything else. Letting thoughts come and go, but also going back to your breath and focusing on that. This form of meditation relates to Dhyana meditation, the 7th limb of yoga, which is the practice of being able to focus on a single object (in this case my breath) and sustain that focus over time.
